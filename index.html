        Water is one of the worlds most important substances.
        Being used everywhere from public consumption to agricultural use and industrial processes, it is essential it is treated and safe for sufficient use. 
        How is this water treated and what methods are used? This article will explain the engineering behind water treatment.
        Although technological advancements increase in water treatment, this article also covers ongoing challenges and difficulties, particularly in lower income countries

          Water treatment is a vital process that guarantees safe and clean water which can be used in a variety of ways such as: 
          drinking, industrial purposes, agricultural use, sanitation and many more.
          Despite water covering 75% of the Earth’s surface, less than 1% of Earth's water is drinkable (John Misachi, 2018).
          It’s clear that safe water is limited. 
          Water treatment is a critical process to ensure water is free from pathogens, chemicals and contaminants, make it safe for consumption or and different uses. 
          This article will cover the importance of water treatment, the processes used in water treatment and challenges in providing clean water.

          What is water treatment?  Water treatment refers to the process of improving quality of water with the purpose of serving an end-use (SafetyCulture Content Team, 2024).
          Clean drinking water is a basic human right and access to it is critical for public health.
          Although being a basic human right the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF states that
          2.2 billion people around the world do not have safely managed drinking water (World Health Organization, 2019).
          This means that around 1 in 3 people globally do not have access to clean drinking water which is saddening especially with the technological advancements
          and every growing knowledge we have today.
          We know untreated water can harbour harmful microorganisms such as viruses or bacteria which cause harmful diseases such as cholera.

          Moreover, water treatment is vital for environmental protection.
          Untreated sewage and industrial waste are leading factors in contaminating water bodies, this leads to pollution and degrades ecosystems, harming many different species and ruining many habitats.
          Effective water treatment prevents contaminants entering and destroying natural habitats, maintaining biodiversity.

        <h3 id="The water Treatment Process">The water Treatment Process</h3>
        <pre>
         There are many different stages within the water treatment process and each stage is designed to move specific types of contaminants.
         The 5 major stages are: Coagulation, Flocculation, Sedimentation, Filtration and Disinfection. (SafetyCulture Content Team, 2024). 
        1.Coagulation: A coagulant (usually aluminium sulfate) is quickly added to water and mixed. The coagulant (being positively charged) neutralises the negative
          charged contaminants (usually natural organic matter like gravel and sand) causing them to clump together which forms larger particles (known as flocs).
          (Brian Campbell, 2022).
        2.Flocculation: Flocculants (usually polyacrylamides in water treatment) added to water after coagulation.
          Flocculants bind the small particles that were neutralised by coagulants together. Flocs then settle to the bottom of the tank to be filtered out of the water.
          (ChemREADY, no date). 
        3.Sedimentation: Once flocs form, they settle to the bottom of the water as they are heavier.
          This separates the solids from the water. (SafetyCulture Content Team, 2024).
        4.Filtration: Separated, clear water passes through filters with various pore sizes, made from a variety of materials such as sand and gravel.
          The filters help remove dissolved particles and unwanted substances from the water. (SafetyCulture Content Team, 2024).
        5.Disinfection: Chemical disinfectants are added to water such as chlorine or chlorine dioxide. 
          The chemical disinfectants remove any final remaining parasites, bacteria or viruses. (SafetyCulture Content Team, 2024).
