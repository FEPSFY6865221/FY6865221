        Water is one of the worlds most important substances.
        Being used everywhere from public consumption to agricultural use and industrial processes, it is essential it is treated and safe for sufficient use. 
        How is this water treated and what methods are used? This article will explain the engineering behind water treatment.
        Although technological advancements increase in water treatment, this article also covers ongoing challenges and difficulties, particularly in lower income countries

        Water treatment is a vital process that guarantees safe and clean water which can be used in a variety of ways such as: drinking, industrial purposes, agricultural use, sanitation and many more.
          Despite water covering 75% of the Earth’s surface, less than 1% of Earth's water is drinkable (John Misachi, 2018).
          It’s clear that safe water is limited. 
          Water treatment is a critical process to ensure water is free from pathogens, chemicals and contaminants, make it safe for consumption or and different uses. 
          This article will cover the importance of water treatment, the processes used in water treatment and challenges in providing clean water.
